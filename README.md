# ADSTNet
This repository is about the work of Adaptive Dual-Stream Sparse Transformer Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images. 


# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our ADSTNet (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYklPLWkK_pbWhQHRjFNKg) (code:ADST ) on ORSSD, EORSSD and ORSI-4199 datasets.

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) (code:hust) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
