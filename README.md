# ADSTNet
This repository is about the work of Adaptive Dual-Stream Sparse Transformer Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images. The code is on the way......

# Datasets
The datasets utilized in this work can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iP7KRFwkS6K4Hako1XQIgg)(code:2r9f), including ORSSD, EORSSD and ORSI-4199.

# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our ADSTNet in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYklPLWkK_pbWhQHRjFNKg) (code:ADST) on ORSSD, EORSSD and ORSI-4199.

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
